This document is intended as a quick-start guide for setting up an SVN repository to track Wordpress' remote plugins directory. While these instructions should be all you need to get set up, 
the official Wordpress guide (listed at the top) is still worth reading through.

Setting up a local repository:

1. Install subversion -- sudo apt-get install subversion
2. Create a new directory for the repository. An existing repository cannot readily be used as SVN enforces a folder structure that is not amenable to local testing
3. svn co http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/good-loop-ad-widget/ This will create a new folder in the current directory and mirror the contents of the remote repository

Making/pushing changes:   
Add a new file/directory: svn add ...
Delete a file/directory: svn delete ... Note that SVN will not register that a file has been deleted if this command isn't used.
Commit changes: svn ci -m 'Commit message'

SVN will automatically pick up on edits to an existing file -- no additional command call is necessary. 

Miscellaneous notes:
There appears to be a ~30 minutes delay between pushing and changes appearing to the public.
SVN's commit is the equivalent of commit + push in GIT.
